Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in the [BMT](https://biomedirobotics.com/) group at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), supervised by Prof. [Samuel Kwok Wai Au](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/au-kwok-wai-samuel/) and Prof. [Yunhui Liu](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/liu-yun-hui/). My research interests are legged robot locomotion, legged manipulation, whole-body control and teleoperation of legged manipulator system, and cooperation control. 

Prior to CUHK, I earned my dual B.Sc. degrees from China University of Mining and Technology, China, and the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany, in 2018, respectively. I received my M.Sc. degree with distinction from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the Technical University of Munich, Germany, in 2021. In the meantime, I was also a master thesis student at German Aerospace Center (DLR), Germany, supervised by Prof. [Christian Ott](https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/en/staff/cott/), focusing on humanoid robot locomotion control. 

I have a passion for robotics and want to build a bipedal robot that can learn and understand the world around it in my free time. Besides robotics, I have a love for learning and sports.
